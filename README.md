# CaseStudy-TelecomChurn
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, I have analyzed customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, built predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn, and identified the main indicators of churn.
 
I have used data imbalance and RFE in the Telecom churn case study.
